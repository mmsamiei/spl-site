I"É<p>WELCOME to Speech Processing Laboratory <strong>(SPL)</strong></p>

<p><strong>SPL</strong> is one of the research laboratories of Computer Engineering Department of Sharif University Of Technology. The main area of the research in this Lab is Digital Signal Processing, specially Speech signals. Speech Recognition is the major field of activity for this group and a speech recognition engine including the latest and successful algorithms is developed. This engine is customized for Persian language including Persian language models (Statistical and Grammatical) and the first version is released as NEVISA, the most robust and accurate Persian dictation system. <strong>SPL</strong> also has developed NEWSHA (T-NEVISA), the high accurate Persian telephony speech recognition including command and digit recognition. Some of derived products from these engines are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Parsia: Persian voice translator</li>
  <li>NevisYar: Persian intelligent typing</li>
  <li>Digit and command recognition</li>
  <li>Telephony doctor</li>
  <li>Persian speech-enabled auto-attendant</li>
</ul>

<p>Other speech-based solutions are available on the labâ€™s partner <a href="http://asr-gooyesh.com">ASR Gooyesh Pardaz</a> Co. web site.</p>

<p>For more information about the projects of this group follow Projects page. Experts in this group are working on various digital speech related research areas such as Speech Enhancement and Speech Synthesis. The summary of the fields of activity of this group are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Digital Speech Processing</li>
  <li>Robust Speech Recognition</li>
