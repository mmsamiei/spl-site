title: Ali Karimi Talks About Unsupervised Data Augmentation for Consistency Training
layout: post-layout
---

In this talk, Ali presents one of the latest papers of the google research group in the semi-supervised learning field. In "Unsupervised Data Augmentation for Consistency Training," researchers demonstrate one can also perform data augmentation on unlabeled data and utilized them to regulate deep neural networks. They achieved state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the IMDB dataset, only using 20 labeled examples.
Main contributions of this paper are:
1- Semi-supervised learning (SSL) can match and even outperform purely supervised learning that uses orders of magnitude more labeled data.
2- SSL works well across domains in both text and vision. 3- SSL combines well with transfer learning, e.g., when fine-tuning from BERT.
